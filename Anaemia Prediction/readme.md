# Anaemia Prediction using Machine Learning

### 📝 Overview
This notebook will introduce some foundation machine learning and data science concepts by exploring %RBC Prints and Hemoglobin levels for classifying whether an individual tends to have anaemia or not. It is intended to be an end-to-end example of what a data science and machine learning **proof of concept** might look like.

Using machine learning techniques, I have deployed a model with **Streamlit** in order to predict anaemia based on historical data. Each row in the dataset corresponds to an individual case with various features.

### 📂 Data Source:
Anaemia Prediction using Hb, Sex, %RBC Prints - Kaggle

This dataset is curated to facilitate the development of machine learning models aimed at predicting anaemia from Image Pixels and Hemoglobin Levels.
