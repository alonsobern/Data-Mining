# Housing Prices Predictions (California) using Machine Learning

### 📝 Overview
This notebook has the aim to present how we can develop a machine learning model applying statistics concepts and data analysis in order to predict the prices of houses in California. It is intended to be an end-to-end example of what a data science and machine learning **proof of concept** might look like.

Using machine learning techniques, I have developed a model to predict the housing price in California based on historical data.

### 📂 Data Source:
California Housing Prices

The data belongs to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory. The target variable is the **median house value** for California districts, expressed in US dollars.

### 🛠️ 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤:
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Geopandas and Geoplot for geographical analysis
- Scikit-learn for model building and metrics evaluations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

### ✨ Highlights:
- Comprehensive dataset analysis 
- High accuracy and recall
- Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations 

### 📈 Key Tasks:
- Exploratory data analysis 
- Data cleaning and preprocessing 
- Feature engineering
