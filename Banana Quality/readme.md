# Predicting Banana Quality using Machine Learning

### 📝 Overview
This notebook will introduce some foundation machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the quality of bananas **classification.** It is intended to be an end-to-end example of what a data science and machine learning **proof of concept** might look like.

Using machine learning techniques, I have developed a model to predict banana quality based on historical data.

### 📂 Data Source:
Banana Quality - Kaggle

The tabular dataset holds numerical attributes describing the quality of bananas, including their size, weight, sweetness (Brix), acidity (pH), softness, harvest time, and ripeness. 

### 🛠️ 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤:
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for model building
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

### ✨ Highlights:
- Comprehensive dataset analysis 
- High accuracy and recall
- Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations 

### 📈 Key Tasks:
- Exploratory data analysis 
- Data cleaning and preprocessing 
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualisation of results
