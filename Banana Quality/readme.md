# Predicting Banana Quality using Machine Learning

### 📝 Overview
This notebook will introduce some foundation machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the quality of bananas **classification.** It is intended to be an end-to-end example of what a data science and machine learning **proof of concept** might look like.

Using machine learning techniques, I have developed a model to predict banana quality based on historical data.
